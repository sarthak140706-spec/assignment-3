Task 1: Factorial Function

Objective:
To create a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a function.

Problem Statement:

Define a function named factorial that accepts a number as an argument.

Calculate the factorial of the number using a loop or recursion.

Return the calculated factorial.

Call the function with a sample number and display the result.

Expected Output Example:
If the input number is 5, the program should return:

Factorial of 5 is 120


Learning Outcomes:

Understanding the concept of functions in Python.

Learning how to use loops and recursion.

Applying logic to solve mathematical problems programmatically.

Task 2: Using the Math Module

Objective:
To create a Python program that performs mathematical calculations using the math module.

Problem Statement:

Prompt the user to input a number.

Use the math module to calculate:

Square root of the number

Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number

Sine of the number (in radians)

Display all calculated results clearly.

Expected Output Example:
If the user enters 25, the program should display:

Square root of 25 is 5.0
Natural logarithm of 25 is 3.2188758248682006
Sine of 25 radians is -0.13235175009777303


Learning Outcomes:

Understanding the use of Python’s built-in math module.

Performing basic mathematical operations programmatically.

Handling user input and displaying formatted results.

Summary

These tasks help in understanding core Python concepts such as:

Functions and recursion

Loops and iterative calculations

Using standard Python libraries for mathematical operations

Handling user input and output formatting
